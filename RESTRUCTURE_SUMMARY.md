## What Was Done

Your CaterVegas project has been successfully restructured to separate frontend and backend code into dedicated folders.

## New Project Structure

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Separate Client and Server Folders
- **client/**: Contains all Next.js frontend code
- **server/**: Contains Express.js backend API

### 2. Moved Frontend Files
- Moved `src/` directory to `client/src/`
- Moved `public/` directory to `client/public/`
- Moved all Next.js config files to `client/`
- Created separate `client/package.json` with frontend dependencies

### 3. Created Backend Structure
- Created `server/index.js` with Express.js setup
- Added basic CORS middleware
- Created `server/package.json` with backend dependencies
- Added health check endpoints

### 4. Updated Root Configuration
- Converted root `package.json` to monorepo management
- Added scripts to run both client and server
- Updated main README with new structure
- Cleaned up old files from root directory

## Available Scripts

From the root directory:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Run both client and server in development
npm run dev

# Run client only
npm run dev:client

# Run server only  
npm run dev:server

# Build both for production
npm run build

# Start both in production
npm run start

# Clean all build artifacts
npm run clean
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm run install:all` to install all dependencies
2. **Test the Setup**: Run `npm run dev` to start both client and server
3. **Verify Functionality**: 
   - Frontend should be available at http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API should be available at http://localhost:3001
4. **Add Backend Features**: Expand the server with authentication, database, etc.
5. **Configure Environment**: Add `.env` files for environment-specific settings

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Clear Separation**: Frontend and backend code are completely separated
- **Independent Development**: Each part can be developed and deployed independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more services or split into microservices
- **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on frontend and backend
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Can deploy to different platforms/services

The restructure is complete and your project is now properly organized for full-stack development!
